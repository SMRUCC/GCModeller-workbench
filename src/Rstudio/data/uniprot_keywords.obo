Most viruses have developed specific proteins to prevent the establishment of an antiviral state. About half of all bacteria and most archaea have a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short plaindromic repeats) system of adaptive immunity to exogenous DNA. CRISPRs clusters are tandem arrays of alternating repeats and spacers, where the spacers in some cases are homologous to sequences from virus and plasmid genomes. The CRISPR arrays are transcribed, processed and in some way aid in detection and resistance to foreign DNA.

Classical features are polydipsia, polyphagia and polyuria, due to hyperglycemia-induced osmotic diuresis. Type II diabetes mellitus normally starts in adulthood and is caused by a lack of sensitivity to the body's own insulin. It is usually characterized by a gradual onset with minimal or no symptoms of metabolic disturbance. Both forms of diabetes mellitus lead to secondary complications (notably cardiovascular, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy).

Some forms of epidermolysis bullosa display tissue separation at the basal cell/lamina lucida interface, at the level of the hemidesmosomes (hemidesmosomal variants).

The terminal mannose is linked to the protein via an ethanolamine attached to the C-terminal of the mature protein. The core structure is conserved from protozoa to humans. There are, however, marked differences in the glycosyl side chains attached to the core glycolipid.

In the most extreme cases, anophthalmia or cyclopia is evident along with a congenital absence of the mature nose. In milder forms (semilobar or lobar holoprosencephaly), rudimentary midline structures are present. The less severe form features facial dysmorphia characterized by ocular hypertelorism, defects of the upper lip and/or nose, and absence of the olfactory nerves or corpus callosum. The majority of cases are sporadic, although families with both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive holoprosencephaly have been described." []

Initially discovered in insects which are devoid of an adaptive immune system and rely only on innate immune reactions for their defense, this immediate response accomplishes many activities including recognition and effector functions. Recognition is mediated by broad specificity, pattern recognition, receptors which recognize many related molecular structures (e.g. polysaccharides, polynucleotides) present in microorganisms but not found in the host. The innate responses include the release of antimicrobial peptides, production of cytokines, acute- phase proteins, complement. Although many different innate immune mechanisms are deployed for host defence, a unifying theme of innate immunity is the use of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors for pathogens or damaged self components, such as the Toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (LRR)- containing receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like RNA helicases and C-type lectin receptors."

They can express viroporins as Adenoviridae or Picornaviridae do in the late phase of infection. Phycodnaviridae for their part seem to express lytic phospholipids. In dsDNA prokaryotic viruses, lysis-specific proteins are expressed: a holin, which permeabilizes the inner membrane and an endolysin which then gains access to and degrades the host peptidoglycans. Some bacterioviruses express a signal-containing endolysin and thus do not need the holin function." []

In plants 2-PG is recycled to 3-PG via reactions in peroxisomes, mitochondria as well as chloroplasts. For every 2 molecules of 2-PG, one molecule of 3-PG is formed and one molecule of CO(2) is lost.

def: "Protein which is part of an anion channel found in the plasma membrane and in intracellular membranes. These channels are permeable for various anions, such as iodide, bromide, but also for nitrates, phosphates and even negatively charged amino acids. They are called chloride channels, because chloride is the most abundant anion and the predominant permeating species in all organisms. They have been classified according to their gating mechanisms, which may depend on changes in the transmembrane electric field (voltage-dependent/gated chloride channels, e.g. ClC family), on a protein kinase/nucleotide mediated mechanism (CFTR), an increase in intracellular calcium (calcium activated chloride channels, e.g. CaCC), cell swelling (volume-regulated anion channels, e.g. VRAC) or binding of a ligand, e.g. glycine or - aminobutyric acid (GABA) activated channels. In contrast with cation channels, they are not involved in the initiation or spread of excitation, but in the regulation of excitability in nerve and muscle. They also participate in many housekeeping processes, such as volume regulation, pH regulation in organelles, electrogenesis and control of synaptic activity. The chloride channels are crucial for transepithelial transport and the control of water flow, and often provide unexpected permeation pathways for a large variety of anions." []

name: RNA-mediated gene silencing
def: "Protein involved in RNA-mediated gene silencing. This term describes a number of related processes which use 21- to 25-nucleotide RNAs to repress the expression of specific target genes. These processes include the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA by either RNA interference (RNAi) or endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) and the transcriptional regulation of mRNA by RNAi-mediated chromatin silencing. RNAi is generally triggered by the presence of dsRNA produced by bidirectional transcription or by the transcription of an inverted repeat or hairpin sequence. dsRNA is processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of around 21 nucleotide which are then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which cleaves mRNAs with sequences fully complementary to the siRNA. miRNAs differ from siRNAs principally in their biogenesis. miRNA genes encode precursors with complex hairpin structures which are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage to form mature miRNAs. Like siRNAs, miRNAs function in RISC-like complexes. Animal miRNAs generally inhibit translation of target mRNAs following imperfect base pairing to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), while most plant miRNAs show nearly precise complementarity to coding regions of target mRNAs and trigger mRNA degradation similar to siRNAs. Finally, in RNAi-mediated chromatin silencing, siRNAs derived from repeat element transcripts are incorporated into the nuclear RNAi-induced initiator of transcriptional silencing complex (RITS), where they guide chromatin modifications such as histone methylation which lead to transcriptional silencing."

Instead, it can remain latent and be passively replicated along with the host genome and passed on to the original cell's offspring; all descendants of the infected cell will also bear it in their genomes. The host's environmental conditions changes can however reactivate the virus leading to viral transcription and production of new infectious viruses (productive infection).

name: T cell receptor
def: "The T cell receptor (TCR) is the antigen receptor expressed on CD4- positive and CD8-positive T lymphocytes that recognizes complexes of peptides bound to self-MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Structurally, TCR is composed of a heterodimer of two disulfide-linked transmembrane polypeptide chains designated alpha and beta, each containing one terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like variable domain, one Ig-like constant domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic region. A less common type of TCR, composed of gamma and delta chains, is found on a small subset of T cells and recognizes different forms of antigens. Each T cell expresses a unique TCR that is generated by randomly assorting genes. This ensures that T cells can respond (at the population level) to almost any infection." []

name: Immunoglobulin
def: "A glycoprotein produced in membrane-bound or secreted form by B lymphocytes. The basic structural unit of an immunoglobulin (Ig) is composed of two identical covalently linked heavy chains and two identical light chains. Both the heavy chains and light chains contain a series of repeating homologous structural units called Ig domains. The N-terminal variable regions of the heavy and light chains form the antigen binding sites, whereas the C-terminal constant regions of the heavy chains interact with other molecules in the immune system. The membrane-bound antibodies serve as receptors that mediate the antigen- triggered activation of B cells. Secreted antibodies function as mediators of specific humoral immunity by engaging various effector mechanisms that serve to eliminate the bound antigen." []

def: "Protein located in or on the magnetosome, a membrane-bound bacterial organelle that envelops crystals of magnetic iron minerals in magnetotactic bacteria. Magnetosomes form linear chains that align along the cellular motility axis at midcell and function in bacterial navigation along the Earth's magnetic field. They are formed by invagination of the cell inner membrane; in some species they remain connected to the inner membrane, in others they pinch off to form independent intracellular vesicles." []

def: "Protein located in or on the carboxysome, bacterial microcompartments in which ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO)-mediated CO(2) fixation occurs. The cytoplasmic polyhedral inclusion bodies are surrounded by a thin protein coat. Found in cyanobacteria and some chemoautotrophs, they enhance autotrophic CO(2) fixation in air by increasing the CO(2) concentration around RuBisCO, thus reducing its reaction with O(2), a competing substrate. They contain carbonic anhydrase as part of the CO(2) concentration mechanism." []

def: "Protein located in or on a bacterial microcompartment (BMC), proteinaceous polyhedral shells that encapsulate enzymes. The selectively permeable organelles protect their contents from the cytoplasm and/or the cytoplasm from reactants in their interior. Examples of BMCs include carboxysomes, which enhance autotrophic CO(2) fixation by encapsulating RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase, as well as BMCs involved in ethanolamine or propanediol degradation; both pathways make toxic intermediates. Artifical BMCs can be expressed and filled with cargo proteins for biotechnological uses. BMCs are found in many bacterial phyla; in most cases their cargo is unknown." []

def: "Protein located in or on an encapsulin nanocompartment, proteinaceous shells that encapsulate enzymes. The selectively permeable, self- assembling 25-42 nm shell is made of only 1 protein, unlike the larger bacterial microcompartment. The shell protein has an HK97-like fold and probably evolved from a viral protein. Artificial encapsulin nanocompartments can be expressed and filled with cargo proteins for biotechnological uses. They are found in many bacterial and a few archaeal phyla." []
